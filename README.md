# Spam Mail Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a **machine learning approach to spam email classification**. The goal is to build a predictive model that accurately classifies emails as either *spam* or *not spam* based on various features extracted from email content. The notebook contains a step-by-step guide to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes cleaning and preparing email text data for analysis.
- **Feature Engineering**: Techniques like tokenization, text vectorization (e.g., using TF-IDF or Count Vectorizer), and more are applied to extract meaningful features from emails.
- **Model Training**: Several machine learning algorithms are used to train the model, such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- **Model Evaluation**: Includes precision, recall, accuracy, F1 score, and confusion matrix to assess model performance.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the notebook:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn nltk
```

- `pandas` for data manipulation.
- `numpy` for numerical operations.
- `scikit-learn` for model building and evaluation.
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.
- `nltk` for text preprocessing (e.g., tokenization, stopword removal).

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading**: The dataset containing labeled spam and non-spam emails is loaded into the notebook.
2. **Text Preprocessing**:
   - Conversion to lowercase.
   - Removal of special characters and punctuation.
   - Tokenization and stopword removal using `nltk`.
3. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Converting text data to numerical vectors using methods like TF-IDF.
4. **Model Training**:
   - Training various classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and SVM.
   - Hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation.
5. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluating the models on test data.
   - Comparison of different models based on key performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall).
6. **Prediction**: Using the best-performing model to predict new, unseen email data.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Install the necessary dependencies listed above.
3. Open the notebook (`Spam_Mail_Prediction_using_Machine_Learning.ipynb`) using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
4. Follow the steps in the notebook to execute the project:
   - Load the dataset (make sure to have the data file if required).
   - Run the data preprocessing cells.
   - Train and evaluate the models.
   - Review the predictions and final conclusions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains labeled email data (spam or not spam). The data needs to be in a CSV format (or similar) with the appropriate structure, including the email text and its associated label.

**Note**: The dataset is not included in this repository. You need to download or use your own email dataset for spam detection.

## Results

The notebook will output evaluation metrics for each trained model and provide a comparison of their effectiveness in classifying spam and non-spam emails. The best-performing model can be selected based on the evaluation.
